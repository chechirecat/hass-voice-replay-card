### Local Development

For rapid development, you can serve the file locally:

```bash
# Serve from your local development directory
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then add `http://localhost:8000/voice-replay-card.js` as a resource for testing.

### Release Automation

This repository includes automated release scripts to streamline version management and releases.

#### Available Scripts

- **Bash:** `scripts/release.sh` (Linux/macOS/WSL)
- **PowerShell:** `scripts/release.ps1` (Windows/Cross-platform)

#### Usage

```bash
# Display help and available options
./scripts/release.sh --help

# Release with automatic patch increment (0.4.0 ‚Üí 0.4.1)
./scripts/release.sh

# Release with specific increment type
./scripts/release.sh --increment minor  # 0.4.0 ‚Üí 0.5.0
./scripts/release.sh --increment major  # 0.4.0 ‚Üí 1.0.0

# PowerShell (Windows)
.\scripts\release.ps1 --help
.\scripts\release.ps1
.\scripts\release.ps1 -Increment minor
```

#### What the Script Does

1. **Safety Checks:**
   - Verifies clean working directory
   - Confirms you're on the main branch
   - Checks for uncommitted changes

2. **Version Management:**
   - Reads current version from `voice-replay-card.js`
   - Increments version (patch/minor/major)
   - Checks if new version already exists remotely

3. **Release Process:**
   - Updates version in `voice-replay-card.js`
   - Commits the change with appropriate message
   - Creates and pushes git tag
   - Triggers GitHub Actions release workflow

#### Version File

Unlike the backend integration, this card has a simpler version management system with the version defined in a single location:

```javascript
// voice-replay-card.js
const CARD_VERSION = '0.4.0';
```

#### Prerequisites for Release

- Clean working directory (no uncommitted changes)
- Must be on the `main` branch
- Git remote `origin` must be accessible
- Proper permissions to push tags to the repository

#### Troubleshooting Releases

- **"Working directory not clean":** Commit or stash your changes first
- **"Not on main branch":** Switch to main branch before releasing
- **"Version already exists":** The script will detect and prevent duplicate releases
- **Permission errors:** Ensure you have push access to the repository
